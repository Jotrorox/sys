# System

> A basic home-manager based nixos config

## Description
This is the config I had built during my endevour into the NixOS-world.\
This is only a personal config and I don't even recommend using it as an inspiration.

# How to use this
If you decide to use (or steal) this just do the following.
BUT PLEASE USE YOUR OWN HARDWARE CONFIG!
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Jotrorox/sys.git
cd sys
nixos-rebuild --flake .#home
home-manager --flake .#johannes@home
```

## DISCLAIMER
THIS IS ONLY A VERY BASIC CONFIG IT IS NEITHER SAFE NOR ACTIVELY MAINTAINED.\
IT WAS ONLY FOR TESTING AND I WILL FOR NOW NOT CONTINUE USING OR DEVELOPING THIS.
